<!-- TODO:
I want it to look pretty much like the add-page page, so I want there to be a title for the report
and a path input that will automatically be prefilled if you click on send feedback on a specific page (through url parameters).
Then there should be a content input where the actual feedback will go and an email field so that we can further contact the person
if we want to discuss more.

The feedback should probably be saved into a new table on firestore and store all this information as well as the time submitted,
the sender's IP address and everything that you normally store.

I want it to look pretty much the same as the add-page page just to keep it consistent.
